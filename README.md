# Engineering Standards Suite — CES / MES / AES

**Engineering Standards Suite** is a unified set of engineering design standards, aimed at defining consistent approaches across both digital and physical systems.

This suite includes:

- **CES (Common Engineering Standards)**  
  Fundamental, minimalistic architectural standards for building solid foundations.

- **MES (Modular Engineering Standards)**  
  Flexible modular frameworks designed for extensibility, composability, and configurability.

- **AES (Advanced Engineering Standards)**  
  Low-level hardware and software interface specifications, including precise architectural and physical design rules.
